Passing data and events around your system via one of Azure's messaging systems allows you to add an additional layer of reliability, asynchronous processing, and the ability to scale different parts of your application separately. The challenge is to decide which service or combination of services you should use for your application. There are three main messaging services within Azure that each have their own purpose: Service Bus, Event Grid, and Event Hub. Azure Storage also has a queue option which should be considered when deciding which service to use.
