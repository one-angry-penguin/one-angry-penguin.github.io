title:  "Is Doubting Yourself a Good Thing?"

There's a Youtube channel I've been watching quite a bit of called 'My Little Thought Tree', and recently he posted a video about [doubting himself as a creator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cil6RoFlKHg) and I started thinking about what effect that might have on myself as a dev.

In particular, I think there's a tendency, at least in my own mind, to equate all doubt as something that I should just ignore. A lot of it comes from good 'ole [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome#:~:text=Impostor%20syndrome%20also%20known%20as,exposed%20as%20a%20%22fraud%22.), which is generally not useful. Does that really mean I should ignore all my doubts about myself or do they actually serve some useful purpose?

While true imposter syndrome is a distortion of reality, I would argue that having some doubt is a good thing. As with most "negative" emotions it exists for a reason and is there to guide my actions. Where it becomes a problem is when it becomes a ruler instead of just a guide. Ignoring it causes over-confidence, but allowing to rule my life leads to an inability to make decisions.

## The Dangers of Overconfidence
To put it simply- overconfidence leads to poor decision making. In the dev world this can be extremely expensive. From poor design decisions, to features no one wanted, to pushing buggy code to production, the development process is full of potential pitfalls. If I always assume that my way is the correct one, I'm going to miss important insight that I may have gained by listening to teammates.
