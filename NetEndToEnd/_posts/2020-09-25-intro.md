I really want to *dig* into .NET. Probably some serious imposter's syndrome going on here- I do work for the company that created .NET after all. What it would take for me to consider myself a .NET expert definitely just up by a huge margin once my brain caught up with where I was working.

The goal is to essentially "read the dictionary" and work my way through the [.NET reference docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/?view=netcore-3.1). Only time will tell if this is a successful endeavor it's certainly ambitious.
